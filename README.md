Graceful degradation ensures an app functions  when newer or more advanced features are not available or fail. Service workers make applications degrade gracefully by ensuring even when the user is not connected to the network or the network is poor, the app will be able to load from the cache and still be functional. This enhances performance as well as resilience so users receive a functional experience even under poor network conditions.
